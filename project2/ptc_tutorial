Command for golang to clone pointcoind and all dependencies:
-u | update the repository
-v | verbose
go get -u -v github.com/PointCoin/pointcoind/...

Command to run pointcoind.
-d debug | enable debug mode
-a "54.84.178.186" | connect to node with ip address
-u "[your rpc username] | username to interact with pointcoind over RPC
-p "[your rpc password] | password to interact with pointcoind over RPC
pointcoind -d debug -a "54.84.178.186" -u "[rpc username]" -P "[rpc password]"

At this point pointcoind should have made contact with the network and should
start downloading the pointcoin block chain from peers.  Download will take a 
few minutes.  You can tell the block chain has fully synced by viewing the 
timestamp of the lastest block logged in stdout.

Acquire a new shell*.  We will interact with the basic commands of the
pointcoind node using the package "pointctl".  Everytime a function is called,
pointctl calls the RPC functions of pointcoind, thus, we must include the
RPC username and RPC password defined previously.

There are two help flags under pointctl.  The first is the general help:
pointctl -h

This will provide all commands and parameters of pointctl.  However, only a
subset of these are available to us at the moment as btcsuite seperates
the functionality of their implemenation (pointcoin is a fork of btcsuite)
and we have only started the core node functionality (pointcoind).  Later, we 
will enable wallet functionality (and you will build your own mining software).

To see enabled pointcoin RPC commands, run the command:
pointctl -u "[rpc username]" -P "[rpc password]" help

You should get a list of available commands which looks similar to below:

addnode
getblockhash
getgenerate
decoderawtransaction
getblockchaininfo
ping
sendrawtransaction
validateaddress
verifychain
getblocktemplate
getchaintips
getdifficulty
getrawmempool
getwork
createrawtransaction
estimatepriority
getaddednodeinfo
getblockcount
gethashespersec
getmininginfo
getnetworkinfo
getpeerinfo
decodescript
getblock
setgenerate
estimatefee
getnettotals
getrawtransaction
gettxout
stop
debuglevel
getbestblock
getbestblockhash
getconnectioncount
getnetworkhashps
help
submitblock
getcurrentnet
getinfo
verifymessage


Let's explore some of this functionality!

View the hash of the pointcoin genesis block:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getblockhash 0

Use the output to view the contents of the genesis block:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getblock [hash from above output]

View the raw hex value of the coinbase transaction within the genesis block:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getrawtransaction [tx hash from block output]

Decode the raw hex and view contents of transaction:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" decoderawtransaction [hex output from getrawtransaction]

Find the height of the pointcoin block chain:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getblockcount

Get the hash of the latest block:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getbestblockhash

View all unconfirmed transactions (this will likely  be empty):
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getrawmempool 
 
Now view some network information. The number of nodes you are conencted to:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getconnectioncount

Get information about your network peers:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getpeerinfo 

Get the total mining power of the network (in SHA256 hashes per second):
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getnetworkhashps 

Get some information about the node running on your machine:
pointctl -u "[user]" -P "[pass]" getinfo


Cool beans! You have installed, synced, and interacted with cryptocurrency 
full node. This, for a long while, was the only way to interact with Bitcoin.
