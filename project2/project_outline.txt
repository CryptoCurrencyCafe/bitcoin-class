Class Goals:
- establish pointcoin
- interact with bitcoin-cli
- learn / write / mining software
- mine blocks
- demonstrate attacks


wahoocoin
tjcoin  (see Jefferson's coin plan: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffplan.asp)
rotundacoin
pizzacoin
Note: name discussion tabled, (it requires a big move for it all to work)


Project Order
Step 1: students set up and connect to pointcoin.
- make some fairly simple code modifications to switch to pointcoin protocol (maybe change block contents/headers?)

Step 2: require students to interact with cli with provided guide, answer brief questions.

[ in teams, but one node per student ]
Step 3: write software to mine pointcoin. (deliverable)
- Cripple standard miner so that it mines at 1/4 or 1/8 actual speed.
- Provide a testing harness for mining their own blocks.
- Let students connect their improved miner to the pontcoind machine.

Step 4: mine 100 coin by due date to recieve 100 on the assignment. (deliverable)
- difficulty level will increase, incentive to start early!
- any transferred coins only count if you have a clear receipt
- buy pizza with pointcoin (set up my address, send email when it arrives)

Step 5: demonstrate attacks against network as a group (could be in class or an optional lab)
- mining pools, witholding attack?

Needed:
(1) pointcoind
    (a) easy way of changing network parameters
    (b) documented changes
(2) reference mining code
(3) block explorer -- try to use blocksafari
(4) determine DNS plan
(5) documentation
    (a) set up of pointcoind
    (b) guide/questions for pointcoin-cli interaction
    (c) advice on how to mine
(6) determine attacks to demonstrate
(7) set up pizza ordering site and pointcoin news site.

Notes:
(3) switch pcbootstrap from small to micro
(3) On robinhood there is a Centos box at 105 with golang and pointcoind installed
