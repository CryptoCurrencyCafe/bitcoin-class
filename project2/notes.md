### RegNet Max PowLimit

2^255-1

### DNS seed

Currently any machine that joins the network must connect to 54.84.178.186.
Due to the way addnode works they might not look for any other peers. 
Obviously this is a problem.

### Change max peers

Make sure that the nodes everbody connects to have a max peers set high!
